        <h2>Overview of Angular Components</h2>

        <section>

          <h3>Models</h3>

          <p>
            Unlike most of the components we'll cover, Angular has few opinions on how to manage your models. Whereas frameworks like <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Model" target="_blank">Backbone</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Model" target="_blank">Ember.js</a> have special objects to model data, Angular requires nothing more than a plain old javascript object. Considering the size and complexity of the JCPenney website, we would be missing out on a great opportunity to DRY our code if we didn't fatten up those models with some extra functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider the example <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/product.coffee" target="_blank">Product</a> model below, which inherits from a bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/base.coffee" target="_blank">ModelBase</a>.
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/jcpinnovation/2cc6b5d786a30f80f12d.js"></script>

          <p>
            While its business logic is certainly oversimplified, hopefully the potential value of a more formally typed and augmented object (as opposed to a data-only object) is becoming apparent. Below is second example, a very simple <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/review.coffee" target="_blank">Review</a> model, which could be useful for parts of the site that call for an average rating.
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/jcpinnovation/96e554b1c2cd70d32de7.js"></script>

          <p>
            It's also worth noting that each of the above-mentioned model classes is the return value for its own Angular service. This allows us to inject the model as a dependency like we would any other Angular module, and because <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services" target="_blank">services are singletons</a>, we don't have to worry about the class being defined more than once. We can even build subclasses, as can be seen in both of the above examples (inheriting from <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/base.coffee" target="_blank">ModelBase</a>) or in <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/department.coffee" target="_blank">this Department model</a>, which is a subclass of <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/category.coffee" target="_blank">Category</a>, which is a subclass of <a href="https://github.com/jcpenney/jcp-responsive-v2/blob/master/src/coffee/models/base.coffee" target="_blank">ModelBase</a>. Once the dependency has been injected, instantiating a new instance is just a matter of typing <code>new Product(productData)</code>. But where does this <code>productData</code> come from and where do models get instantiated, you ask? We'll talk about that in the next section.
